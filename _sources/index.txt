Introduction to Pika
====================

Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.

Using this Documentation
------------------------
This documentation is a combination of both user documentation and module development documentation. Classes called out in the Using Pika section below will cover a majority of what users who are implementation pika in their applications will need.

Using Pika
----------
Pika 0.9a is a major refactor of the Pika library implementing true asynchronous behavior at its core. It is important to understand asynchronous programming concepts to properly use Pika in your application. If you have previously used :py:meth:`~channel.Channel.basic_consume` in an application with Pika v0.5.2 or earlier, you have already implemented callback passing style asynchronous code with Pika.

Adapters
________

Pika provides multiple adapters to connect to RabbitMQ:

- :py:meth:`~adapters.select_connection.SelectConnection`: A native event based connection adapter that implements select, kqueue, poll and epoll.
- :py:meth:`~adapters.asyncore_connection.AsyncoreConnection`: Legacy adapter kept for convenience of previous Pika users. It is recommended to use the SelectConnection instead of AsyncoreConnection.
- :py:meth:`~adapters.tornado_connection.TornadoConnection`: Connection adapter for use with the Tornado IO Loop http://tornadoweb.org
- :py:meth:`~adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingConnection`: Enables blocking, synchronous operation on top of library for simple uses. This is not recommended and is included for legacy reasons only.

Choosing the right adapter for your project is important.

Channel
_______

The core communication with Pika is coordinated via the channel.Channel class. Pika invokes this for you when you call the :py:meth:`~pika.connection.Connection.channel` method.
