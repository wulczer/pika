Pika is a pure-python RabbitMQ client library that supports multiple
methodologies for development including the utilization of common pythonic
idioms in addition to callback-passing-style development commonly found
in asynchronous development models. It is built on an asynchronous
communication foundation which allows for both stand-alone development and
easy integration with common asynchronous development frameworks such as
Tornado and Twisted. Pika supports Python 2.6 through 3.2.
